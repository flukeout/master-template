        Mozilla Clubs offer an <strong>opportunity</strong> to regularly bring digital literacy skills into an afterschool
        environment and participate in a global community of teachers and learners and <a href="#">some links</a>.
        Afterschool programs are the ideal setting for <em>educators</em> and <em>participants</em> to teach and learn digital literacy skills by adapting Mozilla Club
        curriculum.

        <li>Combine these Web Literacy skills with current and new projects that are on and off-line.</li>
      </ul>

      <hr />

      <h2 id="activity-ideas">Activity Ideas</h2>

      <p>
        At your next staff meeting, share the Mozilla Clubs activities and determine how to adapt the
        activities to your afterschool program.  The Web Literacy Basics module, which is comprised of six
        activities, each approximately 45 minutes in length are a great way to start and is easily
        adaptable for many age groups. Participants can try these activities together, and a takeaway
        assignment could be to teach to their parents or other adults in their lives as part of a project.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        There are lots of activities, both online and offline at teach.mozilla.org/activities. Here are a few suggestions to make the most of your afterschool program/Mozilla Club mix:
      </blockquote>

      <h3>Personal Presentation Icebreakers</h3>

      <p>Sit in a circle and...</p>

      <ol>
        <li>When was the first time you remember using the web?</li>
        <li>What is one thing you would love to learn about the web?</li>
        <li>What challenges do you face when it comes to digital use and learning?</li>
      </ol>

      <hr />

      <h3>Post-It Note Q&A/Discussions</h3>

      <p>
        Provide a prompt and have participants write answers/feedback on a post-it note, then
        stick it to a wall. Facilitate discussion afterwards.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>If you had to describe the web in one word, what would it be? Why?</li>
        <li>If you were to connect the web with something you are passionate about, what would it be? (Then discuss as a group how you can do this.)</li>
      </ul>

      <hr>

      <h3>Lo-Fi, No-Fi Activities</h3>

      <p>
        It encourages teamwork, provides opportunity for great discussion, and can surface opportunities
        to build a stronger sense of community within your group dynamic. These can be especially fun
        when hosting a larger event that includes outside community members.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><a href="#">Studio.code.org</a> offers many “unplugged” activities for those with no prior programming experience.</li>
        <li><a href="#">Teach.mozilla.org</a>  offers 19 activities in this lo-fi, no-fi teaching kit.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Group Hack/Remix Challenges</h3>

      <p>
        When you do have connectivity, give these a try. Whatever tool or challenge you decide to use,
        pair your participants into teams to work together to achieve a goal. Add a bit of playful
        competition between teams by adding time restrictions, small prizes, or bragging rights.
